## Overview

Text summarization is a critical Natural Language Processing (NLP) task with applications ranging from information retrieval to content generation. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown remarkable promise in enhancing summarization techniques.




## Application Side of This Work

This repository contains a notebook for generating summaries of YouTube video comments using the OpenAI ChatGPT Text-davinci-003 model. I conducted experiments with different temperature values to assess the quality of the generated summaries. You can access the results in the "Application" folder, specifically in the "youtube-comment-summarizer.ipynb" file.

## Information for Contributors and Collaborators

I encourage contributions and collaboration from the community. Feel free to clone this repository and experiment with various word length and temperature settings to generate your own summaries. I would love to hear about your experiences and insights.
